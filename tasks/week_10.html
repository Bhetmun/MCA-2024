    <h3>Analysis</h3>    
        <p>
        As soon as I listened to the new version, I immediately realised that it had essentially almost changed the song. However, the essence of the piece was still there and underneath the immense noise the song still existed. It was like the program had created its own rendition of the song as opposed to just transcribing it. I would say the key of the song remained the same, it just seemed like too much was added into this new version. After viewing the music sheet, I noticed that there was just so much going on. The arrangements of the notes had mostly changed from the original but the tempo of the song had remained the same. Strangely enough the time signature changed from 6/4 to 4/4. From this task I learned that automated transcription is extremely flawed and probably should not be used much at least without a person working on it afterwards to check for mistakes.
