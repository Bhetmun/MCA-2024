    <h1>Week 2 - Basics of notation</h1>
        <p>For Week 2s task I decided to transcribe a Joji's song titled "Die For You covered by Ethan Han. Attached are images of the transcribed piece through the use of pdf upload using MuseScore Studio: </p>

        <img src="/img/D4UMS.png" alt="D4UMS" style="width:500px">
        <p>The image on the left is the cover score transcribed by Ethan while the imag eon the left was the transcription generated by MuseScore using its pdf upload function. Some changes I needed to add was changing the time signature, instrument since for some reason when I played the song back it was using voices instead of piano, and I would also have to add the artist and song name to the top of the sheet.</p>
