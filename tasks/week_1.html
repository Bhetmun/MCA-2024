         <h1> Week 1 - Basics of Music Data</h1>
    <h2>Task 1 Identifying a Theme</h2>     
         <p>The theme I have chosen for my portfolio is based on the half Japanese half Australian singer songwriter Joji. The reason I have chosen him for the topic of my portfolio is because I have been a long term fan of his music and I want to gain a deeper understanding of his songs.</p>
    <h3>Challenges</h3>
         <p>Some of the challenges I mainly experienced was accessing data. It was extremely difficult to find any notated data that was created by the artist himself, in fact I personally could not find any. Therefore I had to rely on either renditions or covers made by other people to use for my portfolio. To gain access to some of the music sheets there may also be a requirement to pay for a subscription service which allows you to download the pieces uploaded by users. I found that this was a major obstacle in reliably finding sources that could provide me with accurate renditions or covers of the songs that I had chosen. Acoustic and Notated data were the only two examples of data I could personally find, whereas I had to curate my own descriptive data which came from external sources, thus may not be a completely accurate representation of Jojis Music </p>
