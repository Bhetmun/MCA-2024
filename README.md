#Week 1 Task - Identifying a Theme#
The theme of my dataset will be based on the Japanese Australian singer-songwriter Joji. I have chosen Joji as my theme because I am a big fan of their music and their songs resonate with me a lot. 
Some challenges that I expect to face when dealing with music related data may be things such as copyright. Perhaps using some scores especially with newer music may be more difficult unless I were to potentially use a rendition of a particular song. Another potential problem with my theme is given that Joji is a new artist there likely are not many official music sheets that I can use for reference when comparing with the data that I will generate.
